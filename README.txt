Maze Generator by Chis Murphy

Controls:
- Change size of coordinates in maze - G key to shrink to a minimum of 1, T key to grow
- Change width of maze in coordinates - Left Arrow key to shrink to a minumim of 1, Right Arrow key to grow
- Change height of maze in coordinates - Down Arrow key to shrink to a minimum of 1, Up Arrow key to grow
- Change thickness of maze walls - H key to shrink to a minimum of 1, Y key to grow
- Toggle wall visibility - E key
- Move the position of the generation origin coordinate (remains within maze bounds) - A key to move left, D key to move right, W key to move up, S key to move down
- Re-generate maze - Spacebar key
- Reset the maze to default values (coordinate size of 20, width and height of 10, visible walls with thickness of 10, generation origin coordinate of (0, 0) - R key
- Randomise generation origin coordinate - F key
- Randomise first blend color (strongest at the generation origin coordinate) - Z key
- Randomise second blend color (strongest at the coordinate farthest away from the generation origin coordinate) - X key
- Randomise wall color - C key
- Set wall color to black - V key
- Toggle information display - Q key
- Exit application - Escape key

- Feel free to use this application for whatever you would like - however, I would greatly appreciate it if you could credit me with this work and provide a link or reference to https://danceswithpotatoes.wordpress.com/ 
- A quick demonstration as to how the maze generator can be used is as follows:
	- Run the borderless windowed version of the generator.
	- Set the coordinate size to 10 using the G/T keys, the wall thickness to 5 using the H/Y keys, and then set the width and height of the maze to cover the entire window using the arrow keys.
	- Find a pair of random blend colors that you like using the Z and X keys.
	- Randomise the generation origin coordinate using the F key and wait for the maze to complete generation.
	- Press the Q key to turn off the info display and press the E key to turn off wall visibility, and you now have a procedurally generated artwork which can be print-screened and used as a wallpaper for your computer (if you so desire).
	- See the 'Screenshots' folder for examples of what can be created using this method.
